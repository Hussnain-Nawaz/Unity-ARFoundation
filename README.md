# Unity-ARFoundation-AugmentedReality
This Unity project is an example of an AR application that uses plane detection, point cloud rendering, raycasting, and object instantiation to create an interactive AR experience.
Features:
	.Multiple scenes with different AR functionality
	.Plane detection and visualization
	.Point cloud rendering
	.Raycasting to detect user input
	.Object instantiation and manipulation

Getting Started

To use this project, you will need to have Unity installed on your computer. You can download Unity from the official website: https://unity.com/
Once you have Unity installed, you can clone this repository and open the project in Unity.

Scenes
This project includes multiple scenes that demonstrate different AR functionality:

Scene 1: Plane Detection
This scene demonstrates how to detect planes in the AR environment and visualize them using Unity's AR Foundation package. When the scene is loaded, the AR session will start and the camera will begin scanning the environment for planes. When a plane is detected, a visual representation of the plane will be displayed on the screen.

Scene 2: Point Cloud Rendering
This scene demonstrates how to render a point cloud of the AR environment using Unity's AR Foundation package. When the scene is loaded, the AR session will start and the camera will begin scanning the environment. A point cloud of the environment will be rendered on the screen, showing the position and orientation of the detected surfaces.

Scene 3: Raycasting
This scene demonstrates how to use raycasting to detect user input in the AR environment. When the scene is loaded, the AR session will start and the camera will begin scanning the environment. When the user taps on the screen, a raycast will be sent out from the camera and any objects that intersect with the ray will be highlighted.

Scene 4: Object Instantiation
This scene demonstrates how to instantiate and manipulate objects in the AR environment. When the scene is loaded, the AR session will start and the camera will begin scanning the environment. When the user taps on the screen, a 3D object will be instantiated at the location of the tap. The user can then use touch input to move and rotate the object.

AR Implementation
This project uses Unity's AR Foundation package to implement AR functionality. AR Foundation provides a set of tools and APIs that allow you to create AR applications that can run on both iOS and Android devices.

To implement plane detection, point cloud rendering, and object instantiation, this project uses the AR Session, AR Plane Manager, AR Point Cloud Manager, and AR Raycast Manager components provided by AR Foundation. These components allow you to detect planes and surfaces in the AR environment, render a point cloud of the environment, and detect user input using raycasting.

To instantiate and manipulate objects in the AR environment, this project uses Unity's standard GameObject and Transform components. When the user taps on the screen, a new GameObject is instantiated at the location of the tap, and the user can then use touch input to move and rotate the object.
Conclusion

This Unity AR project demonstrates how to implement plane detection, point cloud rendering, raycasting, and object instantiation in an AR application using Unity's AR Foundation package. By using these tools and APIs, you can create interactive AR experiences that can run on both iOS and Android devices.
